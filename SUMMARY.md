## Next Steps

The push to GitHub timed out. To manually push the changes to GitHub:

1. Try pushing again with:
   ```
   git push -u origin master
   ```

2. If that doesn't work, you can use GitHub Desktop or another Git client to push the changes.

3. Alternatively, you can authenticate with a personal access token:
   ```
   git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/Amlanpl0001/MyPortfolioWebsite.git
   git push -u origin master
   ```

All the changes have been committed locally, so you won't lose any work. Once pushed to GitHub, the project will be available at https://github.com/Amlanpl0001/MyPortfolioWebsite.
