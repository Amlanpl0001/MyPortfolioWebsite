# Security Measures

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Portfolio Website project.

## Network Security

### TLS/SSL Configuration

- **TLS Certificates**: Implemented Let's Encrypt for free, auto-renewing TLS certificates
- **HTTP to HTTPS Redirection**: All HTTP traffic is automatically redirected to HTTPS
- **HSTS Header**: Strict-Transport-Security header with a long max-age to enforce HTTPS
- **Strong Cipher Suites**: Only modern, secure cipher suites are enabled
- **TLS Version**: Only TLS 1.2 and 1.3 are supported

### Web Application Firewall (WAF)

- **ModSecurity**: Implemented ModSecurity WAF with OWASP Core Rule Set
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented rate limiting for all API endpoints and login attempts
- **IP Blocking**: Automated blocking of suspicious IP addresses

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Authentication

- **Short-lived Access Tokens**: Access tokens expire after 15 minutes
- **Refresh Tokens**: Refresh tokens for obtaining new access tokens without re-authentication
- **Token Revocation**: Ability to revoke tokens on logout or security breach
- **Token Storage**: Tokens are stored securely in the database with user agent and IP information

### Password Security

- **Argon2 Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using Argon2, a modern and secure algorithm
- **Password Strength Requirements**: Enforced strong password requirements (length, complexity)
- **Account Lockout**: Accounts are temporarily locked after multiple failed login attempts
- **Secure Password Reset**: Secure password reset flow with time-limited tokens

### Access Control

- **Role-based Access Control**: Different access levels for different user roles
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only have access to what they need

## Application Security

### Input Validation & Sanitization

- **Pydantic Validation**: All input is validated using Pydantic models
- **Content Sanitization**: HTML content is sanitized using Bleach to prevent XSS attacks
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries with SQLAlchemy ORM

### CSRF Protection

- **CSRF Tokens**: All forms are protected with CSRF tokens
- **SameSite Cookies**: Cookies are set with SameSite=Strict attribute
- **Custom Headers**: CSRF tokens are validated in custom headers

### Security Headers

- **Content-Security-Policy**: Restricts sources of executable scripts
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls information in the Referer header
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts browser features like camera and microphone

## Database Security

### Secure Configuration

- **Least Privilege Accounts**: Application uses a database user with minimal permissions
- **Schema Separation**: Application data is stored in a separate schema
- **Connection Pooling**: Secure connection pooling with timeout and recycling

### Data Protection

- **Audit Logging**: All database changes are logged in an audit table
- **Encrypted Backups**: Regular backups with encryption at rest
- **Parameterized Queries**: All database queries use parameterization to prevent SQL injection

## Infrastructure Security

### Docker Security

- **Container Isolation**: Services run in isolated containers
- **Regular Updates**: Base images are regularly updated
- **Minimal Images**: Using minimal base images to reduce attack surface

### Monitoring & Logging

- **Comprehensive Logging**: All security events are logged
- **Log Rotation**: Logs are rotated and compressed to prevent disk space issues
- **Request Tracking**: All API requests are logged with client information

### Vulnerability Management

- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular scanning of dependencies for vulnerabilities
- **Security Updates**: Automated security updates for dependencies
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular penetration testing with OWASP ZAP

## Secure Development Practices

- **Security Code Reviews**: All code changes undergo security review
- **Security Testing**: Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- **Security Documentation**: Comprehensive security documentation
- **Security Training**: Regular security training for developers

## Compliance

- **GDPR Compliance**: Personal data is handled according to GDPR requirements
- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against all OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- **Security Best Practices**: Following industry security best practices

## Incident Response

- **Security Incident Response Plan**: Documented plan for handling security incidents
- **Vulnerability Disclosure Policy**: Process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities
- **Regular Security Drills**: Practice responding to security incidents
